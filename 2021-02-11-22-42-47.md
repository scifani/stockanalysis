my first work experience was in a small company which produces atm and ticketing systems. i was in charge of developing and maintaining the middleware between peripherals and user application. The purpose of this middleware is to provide a set of service providers mapping the device functionalities into a standard interface. Each class of devices, for instance cash acceptors rather than printers or pinpads, has its own interface and the user app developer use it to seamlessly pilot devices of different vendors, with different protocols, different logic, and so on.
moreover, i followed the development of the encryption pinpad from scratch. the company often preferred to buy oem rather than developing the single peripherals, but the pinpad was strategic. unfortunately managers were completely unaware about the complexity of the project. it was a nightmare but i am proud of the result. in a team of 5 people we designed the mechanics, the hardware, the firmware and the service provider. we passed the pci certification and went in production with an order of 3000 atms for the second greatest italian bank. my tasks in the project were the development of the cryptographic library for the firmware, the development of the service provider, the test-bench software and post assembly initialization software. moreover i followed the integration with the customer application
